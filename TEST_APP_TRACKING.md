# App Tracking Feature Test Guide

## üéØ Test Objectives
Verify that the app correctly tracks when users open specified apps and notifies group members in real-time.

## üì± Prerequisites
- [ ] Native build running on physical device (not simulator)
- [ ] At least 2 users in the same group
- [ ] Permissions granted (Usage Access on Android, Screen Time on iOS)
- [ ] Stable internet connection

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test 1: Permission Setup
**Objective**: Verify app can request and receive necessary permissions

**Steps**:
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Look for "App Tracking" or "Usage Stats" option
4. Tap to enable tracking
5. Grant permission when prompted by system

**Expected Result**: 
- Permission status shows "Granted"
- No error messages
- App tracking is enabled

### Test 2: App Selection
**Objective**: Verify users can select which apps to track

**Steps**:
1. Create a new group or join existing group
2. Navigate to group settings
3. Look for "Tracked Apps" or "Select Apps" option
4. Choose 2-3 apps to track (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
5. Save selection

**Expected Result**:
- Selected apps appear in group settings
- Apps are stored in database
- Group members can see tracked apps

### Test 3: Real-Time Detection
**Objective**: Verify app detects when tracked apps are opened

**Steps**:
1. Ensure app is running in background
2. Open a tracked app (e.g., Instagram)
3. Use the app for 10-15 seconds
4. Return to Weak Link app
5. Check for any logged events

**Expected Result**:
- Event is logged in database
- No false positives for non-tracked apps
- Detection happens within 5-10 seconds

### Test 4: Cross-User Notifications
**Objective**: Verify group members are notified when someone opens tracked apps

**Steps**:
1. Have User A open a tracked app
2. User B should check for notifications
3. User B should check leaderboard updates
4. Verify real-time updates in UI

**Expected Result**:
- User B receives notification
- Leaderboard shows updated counts
- Real-time events appear in UI

### Test 5: Database Verification
**Objective**: Verify events are properly stored in database

**Steps**:
1. Open Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to events table
3. Check for new entries when apps are opened
4. Verify data integrity (user_id, group_id, app_name, timestamp)

**Expected Result**:
- Events table has new entries
- Data is accurate and complete
- Timestamps are correct
