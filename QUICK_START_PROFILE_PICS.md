5. **Complete the signup/setup**

### What Should Happen

- Image uploads to Supabase Storage
- Public URL is stored in the database

- Other users can see your profile picture in groups

### If It Works

‚úÖ Congratulations! Profile pictures are now public and viewable by other users!

### If You See Errors

Check the console logs for specific error messages. Common issues:

## üìù Optional: Add Update/Delete Policies Later

If you want users to be able to change or delete their profile pictures later, you can add these policies:

```sql
-- Update Policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile pictures"
ON "storage"."objects"
FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Delete Policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile pictures"
ON "storage"."objects"
FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```
